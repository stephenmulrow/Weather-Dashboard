This is your one stop shop for all things weather! 

Search any city and you are immediately presented with the current weather data for that city, which includes the current tempetaure, humidity, UV index, and the wind speed. 

Also, at the same time you are presented with the current weather data for that city, you are also presented with a 5-day forecast for that same city. 

You also see an icon depicting the current weather conditions for that city, and the most recent searches populate in the list for you convenience. 

In order to build this project, I used javascript to pull the info from a weather API. This was a great experience to get more comfortable using APIs and pulling live and updated information and displaying that information to the webpage.
